# MSV2 Status Handoff

Date: 2026-07-05

## Current State

- ESP32 display runtime renders the plant grid, animated pixel art, BLE readings, diagnostics, and phone setup app.
- ESP32 display runtime was last flashed successfully to the display receiver on `COM13` with:
  - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\arduino_display.ps1 upload -Port COM13 -ForceWifiSetup`
  - Current firmware build tag: `MSV2 runtime build 2026-07-05 reboot-screen-fix`
  - Build size after flash: about 2,098,561 bytes, 66% of program storage.
- Phone app supports:
  - Status dashboard.
  - Plant setup.
  - Receiver WiFi setup.
  - Receiver pairing ID/claim code.
  - Config version display.
  - Read-only Cloud Status panel for automatic bootstrap, upload, and config-pull status.
  - Add/Delete plant setup controls that resize the local `cards[]` array before saving to the display.
  - Auto layout by plant count: 6 plants -> `3x2`, 7 plants -> `4x2` with the bottom row centered, 8 plants -> `4x2`.
- Receiver stores local config in LittleFS:
  - `/ui.json`
  - `/wifi.json`
  - `/device.json`
  - `/cloud.json`
- Receiver exposes:
  - `/app`
  - `/ui`
  - `/data`
  - `/snapshot`
  - `/device`
  - `/claim`
  - `/config-meta`
  - `/cloud`
- `/snapshot` returns the cloud-upload payload locally.
- `/snapshot` includes plant setup summary under `config.cards[]` for cloud/app display.
- Receiver-side snapshot upload is implemented behind `/cloud.enabled`.
- `/cloud` reports upload status:
  - last attempt time
  - last success time
  - last HTTP status
  - last error string
- Mock cloud tooling exists:
  - `scripts/mock_cloud_server.py`
  - `scripts/relay_snapshot_once.py`
- Mock cloud server has an auto-refreshing browser dashboard at `/` with plant names and moisture health bars when the latest receiver firmware has uploaded config card metadata.
- Mock cloud server also serves PWA shell routes: `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`, and `/app-icon.svg`, plus iOS home-screen metadata.
- Cloud API draft exists at `docs/CLOUD_API_DRAFT.md`.
- Supabase hosted backend scaffolding exists:
  - `supabase/migrations/001_msv2_cloud.sql`
  - `supabase/functions/receiver-snapshot/index.ts`
  - `supabase/functions/plant-dashboard/index.ts`
  - `supabase/functions/claim-receiver/index.ts`
  - `supabase/migrations/002_msv2_store_snapshot_rpc.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/003_msv2_read_latest_snapshots_rpc.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/005_msv2_receiver_bootstrap.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/006_msv2_receiver_bootstrap_fix.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/007_msv2_hash_secret_bytea_fix.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/008_msv2_pgcrypto_schema_fix.sql`
  - `supabase/migrations/009_msv2_household_share_tokens.sql`
  - `supabase/functions/receiver-bootstrap/index.ts`
- Claim/user access scaffold exists:
  - `supabase/migrations/004_msv2_households_and_claims.sql`
  - `msv2_households`
  - `msv2_household_members`
  - `msv2_receiver_claims`
  - `msv2_claim_receiver`
  - `msv2_read_user_latest_snapshots`
  - `supabase/config.toml`
  - `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- Hosted `plant-dashboard` Edge Function is deployed and returned HTTP 200.
- `claim-receiver` and updated `plant-dashboard` Edge Functions are deployed.
- `plant-dashboard` Edge Function now provides the no-login household app APIs:
  - `/functions/v1/plant-dashboard/api/share-claim`
  - `/functions/v1/plant-dashboard/api/share-snapshots`
  - tested successfully with receiver `MSV2088A3104A7AC`
  - share snapshot read returned `plant_count: 2` with Basil and Mint readings
- Static no-login household app shell exists at `web/plant-dashboard/index.html`:
  - receiver connection with `receiverId` and `claimCode`
  - long random household share tokens
  - share token persistence in browser `localStorage`
  - household-scoped dashboard via the Supabase API endpoints
  - dark Plant Status Center visual style
  - animated plant GIF cards copied to `web/plant-dashboard/assets/plant_gifs/`
  - PWA files exist: `manifest.webmanifest`, `app-icon.svg`, `sw.js`
  - Netlify config exists: `netlify.toml`, `_headers`, `_redirects`
  - unsigned share snapshot API requests return `401 share token required`
- Important: Supabase Edge Functions returned HTML as `text/plain` with `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox`, so the browser app must be hosted as a static page elsewhere. Edge Functions should stay API-only.
- `plant-dashboard` root now returns an API-only JSON note instead of raw HTML.
- Static app package exists at `web/msv2-plant-dashboard-static.zip`.
- Netlify production deploy is live at `https://msv2-plants.netlify.app`.
- Receiver bootstrap scaffold exists so future firmware can register itself after WiFi setup and receive a per-device upload token.
- ESP32 firmware now has first-pass cloud auto-bootstrap:
  - calls `receiver-bootstrap` after station WiFi is connected
  - sends `receiverId`, private `receiverSecret`, `claimCode`, and build tag
  - stores returned `uploadUrl`, per-device `apiToken`, and interval in `/cloud.json`
  - leaves existing manual cloud config alone if an upload URL and token already exist
- ESP32 local app no longer exposes manual Cloud Sync URL/token editing in normal setup; use `GET /cloud` for status and `/cloud` API calls only for debugging/reset testing.
- Auto-bootstrap was tested successfully against hosted Supabase:
  - `bootstrap.lastHttpStatus: 200`
  - `bootstrap.lastError: ""`
  - `hasApiToken: true`
  - `syncIntervalSeconds: 60`
  - cloud sync enabled automatically
- Per-device-token snapshot upload was tested successfully against hosted Supabase:
  - `upload.lastHttpStatus: 200`
  - `upload.lastError: ""`
  - `upload.lastSuccessMs` populated
- Bootstrap SQL fix `006` removes ambiguity in `msv2_register_receiver` by using the primary key constraint in the upsert and `return query` for the returned token row.
- Hash SQL fix `007` updates `msv2_hash_secret` to call `digest(convert_to(..., 'UTF8'), 'sha256')` because the hosted database reported `function digest(text, unknown) does not exist`.
- Pgcrypto schema fix `008` sets `search_path = public, extensions` for the hash/register functions because Supabase reported `function digest(bytea, unknown) does not exist` when `pgcrypto` was not visible from the function search path.
- Firmware now includes bootstrap HTTP response text in `/cloud.bootstrap.lastError` when the cloud returns a non-2xx status.
- Current cloud config path: Supabase can store receiver configs and the ESP32 display can poll/apply newer versions, but the Netlify app hides remote editing for now to keep the hosted app read-only and lower traffic.
- WiFi/setup behavior is currently working well in bench testing:
  - First-time setup can still be tested with `-ForceWifiSetup`.
  - The forced setup build ignores saved WiFi until the setup app saves a choice.
  - Saving home WiFi or local-only mode writes `/wifi.json` and `/wifi-setup-unlock-v2.flag`.
  - After that save, resets should return to the saved mode rather than first-time setup.
  - Local-only mode keeps broadcasting the open `MSV2-Display` AP and returns to the dashboard.
  - If a phone sees `MSV2-Display` but cannot join, forget the saved phone network first because older firmware used password `moisture` for the same SSID.
  - BLE scanning was relaxed to reduce WiFi AP contention: 3-second scans with a 250 ms idle gap, and scan interval/window `120/40`.
  - The save/reboot screen now clears cached pixel-art animation state and suppresses display repainting while restart is pending, so old plant art should not bleed through the reboot message.

## 2026-07-06 Sprite/Art Pipeline Update

- Plant sprite generation was normalized so every generated ESP32 sprite frame is emitted on an `84x84` transparent canvas.
  - `scripts/generate_plant_sprites.py` now supports `--target-width` and `--target-height`, defaulting to `84`.
  - Frames are trimmed, aspect-preserving downsampled if needed, and bottom-aligned on the shared canvas.
  - The generated firmware/header/mobile previews now all use the same canvas dimensions, which keeps art scale consistent across plant choices.
- ESP32 sprite rendering was updated for better sparse-layout sizing.
  - `drawPlantSpriteScaled` and animation diff rendering now use shared sprite geometry.
  - Sprites can draw at crisp integer upscales when a sparse card has room, then fall back to `1x` or downsample for dense layouts.
  - This fixed tiny art in `1x1`, `2x1`, and `3x1` layouts while preserving dense grid fit.
- The ESP32 phone dashboard now caps plant setup at 16 plants.
  - Clicking `Add Plant` at the limit shows `Limit reached: the display supports up to 16 plants.`
  - Saving a config with more than 16 cards is blocked.
  - Embedded service-worker cache was bumped to `msv2-app-v2` so phones pick up the fixed `/app`.
- Two new source sprite sheets were added under `assets/`:
  - `GREEN-BLUE-PURP-PLANTER.png`
  - `YELL-ORG-RED-PLANTER.png`
- New helper script:
  - `scripts/generate_planter_sheet_gifs.py`
  - Detects exact plant components from those sheets using the published sprite sizes.
  - Converts black backgrounds to transparent.
  - Chooses 3 deterministic random color frames per plant by default to keep firmware size reasonable.
  - Upscales sheet-derived GIFs `4x` before the main sprite generator so they visually match the older normalized art after the generator's normal `0.5` scale.
- New generated source GIFs in `assets/plant_gifs/`:
  - `color_vine_pot.gif`
  - `color_grass_planter.gif`
  - `color_round_pot.gif`
  - `color_bonsai_bowl.gif`
  - `color_zigzag_pot.gif`
  - `color_hanging_vine.gif`
  - `color_hanging_clump.gif`
- The planter sheet GIF workflow is documented in `assets/plant_gifs/README.md`.
- Important size note:
  - Embedding all 18 color frames for all 7 new sheet-derived plants made firmware too large at about `112%` of program storage.
  - The final flashed build uses 3 frames per sheet-derived plant and compiles at about `2,059,353 bytes`, `65%` of program storage.
- Final regeneration/flash state:
  - Ran `python scripts\generate_planter_sheet_gifs.py`.
  - Ran `python scripts\generate_plant_sprites.py`.
  - Compiled successfully with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\arduino_display.ps1 compile`.
  - Flashed successfully to the ESP32 display receiver on `COM13` with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\arduino_display.ps1 upload -Port COM13`.

## Last Known User Feedback

- Display and app are working well after the WiFi/setup fixes.
- User confirmed the first-time setup/local network flow looks good for now.
- User noticed a brief visual artifact where pixel art stayed visible during the reboot message; this was fixed and flashed in `2026-07-05 reboot-screen-fix`.
- New plant GIF additions are working in the dropdown after regeneration/flash.
- Latest sprite feedback: normalized old and new sprites now look much closer in size after the sheet-derived GIFs were upscaled before sprite generation.
- Version numbers are visible and incrementing.
- Mock cloud test concept makes sense and looks good.

## Important Preferences

- Prefer static checks and focused edits.
- Keep the ESP32 local-first.
- Cloud features should stay disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- User wants a product path suitable for family/friends: simple setup, phone app, remote monitoring eventually.
- User specifically wants future setup where each ESP32 already has its own ID/secret and, after WiFi setup, connects to cloud automatically without manually entering device IDs into Supabase.

## Suggested Next Work

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/001_msv2_cloud.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
2. Set Edge Function secrets:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `MSV2_RECEIVER_TOKEN`
3. Deploy `receiver-snapshot`, `plant-dashboard`, `claim-receiver`, and `receiver-bootstrap`.
4. Test with PowerShell using `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`.
5. Confirm the ESP32 auto-bootstrap status with `http://BOARD_IP/cloud`.
6. Open hosted dashboard: `https://lyemomfpzkawqecpfufm.supabase.co/functions/v1/plant-dashboard`.
7. Test `web/plant-dashboard/index.html` with `http://BOARD_IP/claim`, deploy the static read-only app, then revisit remote config editing later.
